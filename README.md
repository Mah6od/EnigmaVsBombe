# EnigmaVsBombe
a simple simulation of German Enigma machine and Bombe machine.
The Enigma machine was invented by German engineer Arthur Scherbius at the end of World War I. 
The German firm Scherbius & Ritter, co-founded by Scherbius, patented ideas for a cipher machine in 1918 and began marketing the finished product under the brand name Enigma in 1923,
initially targeted at commercial markets.
Early models were used commercially from the early 1920s, and adopted by military and government services of several countries, most notably Nazi Germany before and during World War II
