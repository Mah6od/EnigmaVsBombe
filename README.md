# EnigmaVsBombe
a simple simulation of German Enigma machine and Bombe machine.
The Enigma machine was invented by German engineer Arthur Scherbius at the end of World War I. 
The German firm Scherbius & Ritter, co-founded by Scherbius, patented ideas for a cipher machine in 1918 and began marketing the finished product under the brand name Enigma in 1923,
initially targeted at commercial markets.
Early models were used commercially from the early 1920s, and adopted by military and government services of several countries, most notably Nazi Germany before and during World War II

The bombe was an electro-mechanical device used by British cryptologists to help decipher German Enigma-machine-encrypted secret messages during World War II. The US Navy and US Army later produced their own machines to the same functional specification, albeit engineered differently both from each other and from Polish and British bombes. 
At the Park, Alan Turing was asked to find a way to break Enigma messages. Because of changes to the German operating procedures and the introduction of extra wheels, the Polish Bomba was now obsolete. Turing's attack was based on the use of ‘cribs’ (comparing patterns of the encrypted message and a known portion of plain text) to break the key. This approach was aided by the fact that no letter on the Enigma could be represented by itself in an enciphered message.

Turing realised that his approach was capable of being mechanised, and his invention of the Bombe, together with Gordon Welchman's diagonal board, (which dramatically reduced the number of invalid stops - false positives) increased throughput to the point that the Bombe became a major success.

The first Turing-Welchman Bombe based machine, known as Agnus Dei or simply Agnes, became operational in August 1940.

The engineering and construction of the original Bombes was the work of the British Tabulating Machine Company – BTM (which was later responsible for the 1950s HEC computer now at TNMOC).
